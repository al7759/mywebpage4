 <h1>all the diffrent type of mobs</h1>  
 <h2>Utility</h2>
 <p>Utility mobs are created by players. They can protect players and villagers from hostile mobs (with the exception of creepers). They usually attack hostile mobs, but in certain situations, they will attack any type of mob or the player. An example is the Wither, which attacks all mobs except mobs that are considered undead.<P>
 
  <h1>passive</h2>
              
 <p>Passive mobs are harmless to players and usually will flee if attacked. They provide beneficial items for players if the right tool is used (eg. shears to collect wool or a bucket to collect milk). Some mobs become passive only after they are tamed such as utility mobs. Some of these can also protect a player from hostile mobs.</p>
  
  <h2>Neutral<h2>
<p>Neutral mobs will attack a player only when provoked. They will not attack the player and have different behavior under usual circumstances otherwise. They may help attack other mobs as well. For example, untamed wolves will attack any nearby rabbits, sheep, baby turtles, and skeletons.</p>
 
   
   <h2>Hostile</h2>   
   
   <p>Hostile mobs will attack a player when they get within a certain range. For most hostile mobs, the range is typically 16 blocks, without any obstructions. Some mobs can sense a player from much farther away, such as ghasts, who detect all players within 100 blocks.</p>
   
   <h2>Boss</h2>
   <p>A boss mob is a special type of hostile mob that has an exceptionally large amount of health, a larger detection range, and triggers a health bar and name to appear at the top of a player's screen when they are within range. They are known as boss mobs due to their exceptional difficulty and are only recommended to be faced by experienced players. There are currently only two confirmed boss mobs within Minecraft.</P>
