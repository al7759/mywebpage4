 <h1>Utility</h>
 <p>Utility mobs are created by players. They can protect players and villagers from hostile mobs (with the exception of creepers). They usually attack hostile mobs, but in certain situations, they will attack any type of mob or the player. An example is the Wither, which attacks all mobs except mobs that are considered undead.<P>
 
  <h1>passive</h1>
              
 <p>Passive mobs are harmless to players and usually will flee if attacked. They provide beneficial items for players if the right tool is used (eg. shears to collect wool or a bucket to collect milk). Some mobs become passive only after they are tamed such as utility mobs. Some of these can also protect a player from hostile mobs.</p>
